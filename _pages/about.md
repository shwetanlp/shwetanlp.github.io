I am an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). I earned my Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Indian Institute of Technology Patna, India.

My research interests lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Healthcare-informatics, Biomedical Text Mining, and Computational Social Science. I aim to develop effective and efficient machine learning algorithms to accelerate the development of artificial intelligence in the healthcare and medical domains. I have a strong commitment to interdisciplinary collaboration and have experience working on emerging real-world problems in healthcare and social sciences. 

My current research focuses on developing computational methods for medical document summarization, disease progression, and the prediction of health outcomes from electronic health records and social media.
