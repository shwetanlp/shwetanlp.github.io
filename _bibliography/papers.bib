abstract = {Darknet crypto markets are online marketplaces using crypto currencies (e.g., Bitcoin, Monero) and advanced encryption techniques to offer anonymity to vendors and consumers trading for illegal goods or services. The exact volume of substances advertised and sold through these crypto markets is difficult to assess, at least partially, because vendors tend to maintain multiple accounts (or Sybil accounts) within and across different crypto markets. Linking these different accounts will allow us to accurately evaluate the volume of substances advertised across the different crypto markets by each vendor. In this paper, we present a multi-view unsupervised framework (eDarkFind) that helps modeling vendor characteristics and facilitates Sybil account detection. We employ a multi-view learning paradigm to generalize and improve the performance by exploiting the diverse views from multiple rich sources such as BERT, stylometric, and location representation. Our model is further tailored to take advantage of domain-specific knowledge such as the Drug Abuse Ontology to take into consideration the substance information. We performed extensive experiments and demonstrated that the multiple views obtained from diverse sources can be effective in linking Sybil accounts. Our proposed eDarkFind model achieves an accuracy of 98% on three real-world datasets which shows the generality of the approach. },

    abstract = "One of the cardinal tasks in achieving robust medical question answering systems is textual entailment. The existing approaches make use of an ensemble of pre-trained language models or data augmentation, often to clock higher numbers on the validation metrics. However, two major shortcomings impede higher success in identifying entailment: (1) understanding the focus/intent of the question and (2) ability to utilize the real-world background knowledge to capture the con-text beyond the sentence. In this paper, we present a novel Medical Knowledge-Enriched Textual Entailment framework that allows the model to acquire a semantic and global representation of the input medical text with the help of a relevant domain-specific knowledge graph. We evaluate our framework on the benchmark MEDIQA-RQE dataset and manifest that the use of knowledge-enriched dual-encoding mechanism help in achieving an absolute improvement of 8.27{\%} over SOTA language models.",

    abstract = "The quest for seeking health information has swamped the web with consumers{'} healthrelated questions, which makes the need for efficient and reliable question answering systems more pressing. The consumers{'} questions, however, are very descriptive and contain several peripheral information (like patient{'}s medical history, demographic information, etc.), that are often not required for answering the question. Furthermore, it contributes to the challenges of understanding natural language questions for automatic answer retrieval. Also, it is crucial to provide the consumers with the exact and relevant answers, rather than the entire pool of answer documents to their question. One of the cardinal tasks in achieving robust consumer health question answering systems is the question summarization and multi-document answer summarization. This paper describes the participation of the U.S. National Library of Medicine (NLM) in Consumer Question and Multi-Answer Summarization tasks of the MEDIQA 2021 challenge at NAACL-BioNLP workshop. In this work, we exploited the capabilities of pre-trained transformer models and introduced a transfer learning approach for the abstractive Question Summarization and extractive Multi-Answer Summarization tasks by first pre-training our model on a task-specific summarization dataset followed by fine-tuning it for both the tasks via incorporating medical entities. We achieved the second, sixth and the fourth position for the Question Summarization task in terms ROUGE-1, ROUGE-2 and ROUGE-L scores respectively.",
