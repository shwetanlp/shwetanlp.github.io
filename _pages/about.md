I am a currently a Bridge to the Faculty (B2F) fellow in the Computer Science (CS) Department at the University of Illinois Chicago (UIC). I received my Ph.D. degree in computer science from the Indian Institute of Technology Patna, India in 2019. After my Ph.D., I joined Wright State University, Ohio (2019-2020) as a postdoctoral researcher, followed by a position as a postdoctoral research fellow in the U.S. National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health (NIH) (2020-2021).

My research interests lie at the intersection of Natural Language Processing, Healthcare-informatics, Biomedical Text Mining, and Computational Social Science. I aim to develop effective and efficient machine learning algorithms to accelerate the development of artificial intelligence in the healthcare and medical domains. I have a strong commitment to interdisciplinary collaboration and has experience working on emerging real-world problems in healthcare and social sciences. 

My current research works focus on developing computational methods for medical document summarization, disease progression, and prediction of health outcomes from electronic health records and social media.
